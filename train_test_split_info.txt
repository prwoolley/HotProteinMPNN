Two datasets, s2c2 and s2c5.
Both s2c2 and s2c5 directories have d[1,2]_X.pkl and d[1,2]_X_classification.pkl files.

d[1,2]_X.pkl have four keys ['train_names','test_names','train_labels','test_labels']
    ['train_names','test_names'] have IDs for structures
    ['train_labels','test_labels'] have Temps for structures

d[1,2]_X_classification.pkl have four keys ['train_names','test_names','train_labels','test_labels']
    ['train_names','test_names'] have IDs for structures
    ['train_labels','test_labels'] have Temp classification for structures [0,1] for d1_X_classification, [0,1,2,3,4] for d2_X_classification

For d[1,2]_X_, where X in [0,9], each X is an instance of 10-fold CV.
